# SealHAT PC Application

This application is currently under construction. It currently contains many relics 
of the application from which it was founded.

This application will be used to aid in the initial setup and configuration of the 
SealHAT device. Sensors may be disabled and enabled from this application and their 
sampling frequencies may be set. In addition, power, storage, and lifetime estimates
will be given within this application based on sensor choices. 

This application will also be used to retrieve data from the device once its deployment
period is complete.
